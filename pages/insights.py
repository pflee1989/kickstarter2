            ## Insights
            
            The picture below demonstrates the important features in our model, a random forest classifier. The graph illustrates the time-tested truth that fund-rasing success is in the number of willing investors. However, the reality is much more intricate. The 4th most important factor, the subcategory, which shows the backers' demands, in reality often makes 
            or break the deal. 
            
            
            In plain English, the classifers detect failures (about 35% of total cases) in a human-like manner, by looking at the obvious. Meanwhile, the sub-categories, which is ranked as the 4th most important feature, is the factor most sensitive to the backers' demand. As analysts and investors, we live with the best tools and their limits. In this case, our
            models thinks like us-- thus, we must look beyond human impulses. After all as in all good investments, honesty is in details, and good projects are highly tailored to specific needs. Let us all judge investments with caution.
